#+TITLE: Notes about stuff


- We need a way to generate the id's for variables and build env tables for
  builtin functions, we should do this by having a table of builtin variables and
  builtin functions, on the C side builtin variables will have an externed
  =var_id= that is supplied by the code that the compiler generates, aswell as
  an externed =env_id= for builtin functions, which will be included in the env table

* TODO
- Make sure that we don't have any objects that can be allocated on the stack
  but then allocate non-shared pointers to the heap (resulting in memory leaks)
- There's some bug that causes us to generate code that creates a two var
  closure then invokes it as a one var closure, and vice versa
- Remove the transform_lits transformation, it's a noop atm.
- Make throwaway variables actually throw away, don't add to environment.
